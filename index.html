                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card__back">
                    <p>I think I have a pretty unique personal history. I grew up in one of the biggest cities in China, and when I was 14,
                        I enrolled in an all-boy boarding school in Virginia. The transition from a bustling city to a small school in the
                        mountains was challenging, yet it shaped my present identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>I learned to be adaptable, to navigate diverse settings. The experience made me independent, more self-sufficient.
                        Living in a communal enviroment with people who came from different countries, communities, family backgrounds eriched my abilities for teamwork and collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now that I moved again to LA, I found myself appreciating the convinience of cities more than when I was a kid, but I
                        sometimes miss the tranquil life in small towns. The fusion of urban and rural life styles and the exposure to a
                        global community led me to create my own identity.</p>

                    <p>I love coffee. I have an unhealthy collection of coffee-making gadgets, and not enough room to store them.</p>
                    <p>I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, specifically comedies and dramas. My favorite movie is Lost in Translation (I have a thing for slice of life movies)</p>
                    <p>I enjoy reading science fictions and fictions in general. My favorite sci-fi book is Dune and my two favorite books of
                        all time are Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami and The Island by Victoria Hislop.
                    </p>
                    <p>3D printing is another hobby of mine. I have made things ranging from cursed objects to macro pads.</p>
